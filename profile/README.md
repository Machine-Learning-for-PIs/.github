## Welcome to the Machine Learning for Principal Investigators course page

This is the course page for the course taught at the University of Bonn.
The course programme includes four course days covering key concepts in machine learning.

### Recommended reading:
- We recommend the [Python-Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) to get started.
